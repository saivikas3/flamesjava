# flamesjava
A simple Java program to implement the popular "FLAMES"

 First, removeCommon() function removes the common characters.
 Then, the total number of remaining characters is calculated as n.
 Then, the flames() function removes each character by moving n places recursively 5 times.
 The remaining character (any one of f,l...,s) specifies the relationship compatibility.
 
 Disclaimer: This calculation is just for fun. :)
